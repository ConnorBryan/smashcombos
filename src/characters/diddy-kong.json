  "description": "Diddy Kong was nerfed from his previous iteration in Super Smash Bros. 4. His Monkey Flip most notably travels a shorter distance which worsens his overall movement and neutral. Banana also has more startup lag making it harder for him to instantly hold bananas when he pulls one out. Down tilt was also nerfed which prevents Diddy from being able to combo into up smash and combo off of the move reliably. His grab game was also toned down as his grab has more startup and endlag and his combo throws have either more endlag or more knockback which significantly hinders their combo potential. His up special also travels a shorter distance which nerfs his recovery as well as his weight being lowered. Diddy Kong's nerfs seem to outweigh his strengths and he is worse than his iteration in Smash 4, but to what extent is currently unknown.",
