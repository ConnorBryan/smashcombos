  "description": "Chrom's primary differences from Roy are his up special, Soaring Slash, and his lack of a sweetspot and sourspot on his sword. Chrom's retention of Roy's high air speed allows him decent survivability with his second jump; conversely, his extremely ineffective recovery gives him a low offstage presence and makes him very easy to gimp.  On the other hand, due to Chrom using the weighted average of Roy's damage numbers, most which are extremely polarized in power, Chrom's overall damage and KO potential are both above average. Additionally, his balanced blade gives him greater effective range, allowing him to space out the opponent much like his ancestor Marth and daughter Lucina, while still remaining effective up close, especially when taking into account his effective dash dance and approach speed.",
