{"name":"Dark Samus","render":"../../static/img/placeholder.png","description":"As with some Echo Fighters, Dark Samus is nearly identical gameplay-wise to Samus, with barely-noticeable differences. However, she has many basic animations that are different from Samus, a more standard roll which does not involve turning into a Morph Ball, electric effects instead of fire effects for most of Samus's fire-based moves, and slightly different hitboxes for a handful of moves.","attributes":{"airAcceleration":{"baseValue":"0.04","maxAdditional":"0.05","rank":"21","total":"0.09"},"airSpeed":{"maxAirSpeed":"1.103","rank":"33"},"fallSpeed":{"fastFallSpeed":"2.168","maxFallSpeed":"1.33","rank":"63","speedIncrease":"60%"},"runSpeed":{"maxRunSpeed":"1.654","rank":"44"},"walkSpeed":{"maxWalkSpeed":"1.115","rank":"42"},"weight":{"class":"heavyweight","rank":"8","value":"108"}},"tags":["floatie"],"combos":[{"percentages":{}}],"preview":"","content":"\n\n","basename":"dark-samus","id":"c8f5cd39-9a58-40ab-8e94-01c2fabe88b2","slug":"dark-samus"}
