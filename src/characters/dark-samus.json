  "description": "As with some Echo Fighters, Dark Samus is nearly identical gameplay-wise to Samus, with barely-noticeable differences. However, she has many basic animations that are different from Samus, a more standard roll which does not involve turning into a Morph Ball, electric effects instead of fire effects for most of Samus's fire-based moves, and slightly different hitboxes for a handful of moves.",
