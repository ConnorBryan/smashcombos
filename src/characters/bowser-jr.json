  "description": "While Bowser Jr. did not receive as many direct changes to his standard moveset compared to the rest of the cast, he did obtain some notable improvements due to his attributes and special moves. Overall, Bowser Jr.'s moveset and gimmicks has been retooled to be more consistent and significantly less situational that in Smash 4, allowing him to zone opponents more effectively. As of now, it is unknown how his changes will affect him compared to the rest of the cast.",
