{"name":"Cloud","render":"../../static/img/cloud.png","description":"Cloud has been nerfed overall from his transition into Ultimate. While his recovery is safer and his aerials have less landing lag, his range and damage output have been nerfed, worsening his combo game, and his smash attacks have more ending lag. His most significant nerf is to the changes of his Limit Break, which disappears if not used up in 15 seconds; this means that Cloud has to be more cautious of his Limit. He also will lose a bit of its charge if he is attacked while charging, meaning Cloud has to play safer while doing so.","attributes":{"airAcceleration":{"baseValue":"0.01","maxAdditional":"0.06","rank":"46","total":"0.07"},"airSpeed":{"maxAirSpeed":"1.155","rank":"19"},"fallSpeed":{"fastFallSpeed":"2.688","maxFallSpeed":"1.68","rank":"25","speedIncrease":"60%"},"runSpeed":{"maxRunSpeed":"2.167","rank":"11"},"walkSpeed":{"maxWalkSpeed":"1.155","rank":"34"},"weight":{"class":"middleweight","rank":"25","value":"100"}},"tags":["fastFaller"],"combos":[{"percentages":{},"uuid":"86a66a14-a116-4b4f-89bb-b31c0c7d42da"}],"preview":"","content":"\n\n","basename":"cloud","id":"ae87f80a-1759-458d-ac57-433a606212b3","slug":"cloud"}
