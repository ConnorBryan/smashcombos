      "notes": "On most stages, you would have to hit this near the edge to carry the opponent all the way across the stage, otherwise you can't follow up after the second SH-Fair. First up air needs to be falling, final neutral special is key. Since all the other fruits are too slow, I think key is the only real finisher. As far as I can tell, it doesn't work on balloon weights, and is difficult to pull off on featherweights depending on their character's size. "
