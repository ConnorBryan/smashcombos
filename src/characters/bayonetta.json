  "description": "Bayonetta in Smash 4 was considered by many players as the best character in the game, even after having received nerfs in updates, due to many of her extreme advantages remaining intact, including most infamously her ability to KO opponents at virtually any percentage with successful ladder combos. These traits often caused players to label her as \"broken\", and many matches involving her became controversial, including one at the Super Smash Bros. Invitational 2018, where the top professional Bayonetta player MKLeo pulled off a ladder KO in front of Masahiro Sakurai. Possibly as a result of these events, Bayonetta has been significantly nerfed in the transition to Ultimate, and is by far the most nerfed character in the game, in a similar vein to Meta Knight in Smash 4.",
