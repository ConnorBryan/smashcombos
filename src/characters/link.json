  "description": "Link has been changed from SSB4 to SSBU. He loses some setups from 2 jabs but gains kill power and a remotely-detonated Bomb. Link has several kill moves on the ground (ssmash, stilt, usmash) and a few in the air (uair, fair). Link can also be used as a Zoner; his arrows, bomb, and boomerang can be used to keep the opponent away. Link has decent combo potential and exceeds at killing the opponent.",
