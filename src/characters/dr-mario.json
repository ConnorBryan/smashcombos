  "description": "As a clone of Mario, Dr. Mario is a middleweight with the ability to wall jump. Dr. Mario sports subpar mobility, however, having the sixty-second fastest walking speed, seventy-first fastest dashing speed, seventieth fastest air speed, poor air acceleration, tying for the forty-ninth through fifty-first fastest falling speed, tying for the forty-seventh through forty-ninth fastest fast falling speed, having average gravity and traction, and below-average jump force. As a result of these traits, Dr. Mario's approach and recovery are inferior to Mario's, and renders him with sluggish movement, despite his increased walking and dashing speeds.  Like Mario, Dr. Mario has excellent frame data, with his entire moveset having low startup lag, excluding specials. As a result, Dr. Mario is effective at punishing his opponents, while he himself is difficult to punish. Dr. Mario has excellent combo starters in his forward tilt and down tilt, since both attacks come out rather quickly, and deal low knockback to the opponent. All of Dr. Mario's aerials have decreased landing lag compared to his previous appearance in SSB4 (but still higher than Mario's), contributing to his combo game, and making set-ups easier to create.",
