  "description": "Despite being a strong character in Smash 4, Pikachu has been buffed during the transition. Its overall speed has been increased and most of his moves have much less ending and landing lag, increasing Pikachu's combo potency. Its most significant buff is its altered neutral air and down air, the former now acting like Mewtwo's neutral air and having combo potential, and the latter obtaining the ability to meteor spike.  However, Pikachu is not without its nerfs, the most significant being the increased starting and ending lag on his grabs and the altered knockback of up throw, which worsens its combo potential.  Nevertheless, Pikachu is still an excellent character in Ultimate that has significantly improved, but it is unknown where he will end up in the long run.",
