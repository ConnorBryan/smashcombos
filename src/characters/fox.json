{"name":"Fox","render":"../../static/img/fox.png","description":"Fox received a mix of buffs and nerfs during his transition from Smash 4. All of his aerials have less landing lag, and his mobility has seen minor improvements. His KO options (such as back air and up smash) have received buffs as well, granting him having access to some new kill setups that weren't possible in his previous iterations. Fox also greatly benefits from the game's engine changes and new mechanics, with run cancelling allowing him to approach with his great grounded options and revamped airdodges making his powerful juggling options even more so.  However, Fox also received some noticeable nerfs, the most significant being his worse recovery, as Fire Fox's travel distance is shorter, Reflector only allows stalling once and Fox Illusion no longer bypasses shields, making it much more difficult for him to get back on the stage. He is also even lighter than before, worsening his already poor endurance.  Overall, Fox's tremendous strengths and advantages are now even better than they used to be, but his key weaknesses are significantly more exploitable, which makes it uncertain as to whether he was buffed or nerfed from Smash 4 to Ultimate.","attributes":{"airAcceleration":{"baseValue":"0.01","maxAdditional":"0.08","rank":"21","total":"0.09"},"airSpeed":{"maxAirSpeed":"1.11","rank":"32"},"fallSpeed":{"fastFallSpeed":"3.36","maxFallSpeed":"2.1","rank":"1","speedIncrease":"60%"},"runSpeed":{"maxRunSpeed":"2.402","rank":"5"},"walkSpeed":{"maxWalkSpeed":"1.523","rank":"3"},"weight":{"class":"featherweight","rank":"72","value":"77"}},"tags":["fastFaller"],"combos":[{"percentages":{},"uuid":"2d28bd5f-ad0d-40b2-88e4-65ba5a6c4aa5"}],"preview":"","content":"\n\n","basename":"fox","id":"5d8eea5f-5283-48ad-bad5-6058a213441b","slug":"fox"}
