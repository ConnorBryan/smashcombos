{"name":"Mario","render":"../../static/img/mario.png","description":"Mario has received a mix of buffs and nerfs in the transition to Ultimate, but has been generally nerfed overall. Having been considered one of the best characters in SSB4, Mario's combo potential - his primary strength in that game - has been dampened somewhat, in a similar manner to Zero Suit Samus. As such, while Mario retains his strong, balanced overall attributes, he can no longer rely on up tilt chains to rack up damage, and is generally more of the \"all-rounder\" he was intended to be rather than specializing in rushdown more than other elements.","attributes":{"airAcceleration":{"baseValue":"0.01","maxAdditional":"0.07","rank":"31","total":"0.08"},"airSpeed":{"maxAirSpeed":"1.208","rank":"12"},"fallSpeed":{"fastFallSpeed":"2.4","maxFallSpeed":"1.5","rank":"50","speedIncrease":"60%"},"runSpeed":{"maxRunSpeed":"1.76","rank":"32"},"walkSpeed":{"maxWalkSpeed":"1.155","rank":"34"},"weight":{"class":"middleweight","rank":"27","value":"98"}},"killConfirms":[{"input":"1","percentages":{"balloonweight":"1","featherweight":"1","heavyweight":"1","lightweight":"1","middleweight":"1","superheavyweight":"1"}}],"combos":[{"input":"2","percentages":{"balloonweight":"1","featherweight":"1","heavyweight":"1","lightweight":"1","middleweight":"1","superheavyweight":"1"}}],"preview":"","content":"\n\n","basename":"mario","id":"0b052b2f-d552-4553-a0d0-cf8fd0a9576d","slug":"mario"}
