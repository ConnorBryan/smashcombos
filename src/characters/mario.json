  "description": "Mario has received a mix of buffs and nerfs in the transition to Ultimate, but has been generally nerfed overall. Having been considered one of the best characters in SSB4, Mario's combo potential - his primary strength in that game - has been dampened somewhat, in a similar manner to Zero Suit Samus. As such, while Mario retains his strong, balanced overall attributes, he can no longer rely on up tilt chains to rack up damage, and is generally more of the \"all-rounder\" he was intended to be rather than specializing in rushdown more than other elements.",

This combo extensions grants the combo MASSIVE damage, eliminating over half of your opponents stock in most cases. \n\nAlso, depending on damage and DI, a short hop up-air may be necessary to extend the combo skipping the regrab. The rest of the combo works normally. "
