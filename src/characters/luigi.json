  "description": "The Ultimate transition was really benefic for Luigi. Not only he's overall buffed in terms of speed and damage, but he also got a notorious 0-to-death, consisting of DThrows startups and finishing in almost whatever the player wants. Yes, even UpB. That's simple : Get grabbed, and you lose a stock.\n\nEven out of this 0-to-death, DThrow combos into every single move and his grab is now a tether. The only regret would be his DownB (Unfamous Mash B) which no longers has utility for recovering\nA must-play for any combos fan.",
