description: >-
  Charizard returns as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but
  unlike in Super Smash Bros. 4, it returns as part of Pokémon Trainer alongisde
  Squirtle and Ivysaur. Due to this, Rock Smash has been replaced by Pokémon
  Change. Like Squirtle and Ivysaur, it is no longer subject to stamina, and
  thus remains effective throughout a fight. Unlike Brawl, where Pokémon Trainer
  is a starter character, and Smash 4, where Charizard is, Pokémon Trainer is
  now an unlockable character.
