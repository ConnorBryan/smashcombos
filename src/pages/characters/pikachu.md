description: >-
  Despite being a strong character in Smash 4, Pikachu has been buffed during
  the transition. Its overall speed has been increased and most of his moves
  have much less ending and landing lag, increasing Pikachu's combo potency. Its
  most significant buff is its altered neutral air and down air, the former now
  acting like Mewtwo's neutral air and having combo potential, and the latter
  obtaining the ability to meteor spike.  However, Pikachu is not without its
  nerfs, the most significant being the increased starting and ending lag on his
  grabs and the altered knockback of up throw, which worsens its combo
  potential.  Nevertheless, Pikachu is still an excellent character in Ultimate
  that has significantly improved, but it is unknown where he will end up in the
  long run.
