description: >-
  Bowser received a mix of buffs and nerfs, but he is buffed overall, in spite
  of previously being a high-tier character (ranking 24th out of 55). Most of
  his changes are to make him better at defensive play through the amplification
  of Heavy Armor on tilts and smash attacks and having increased grounded and
  aerial mobility. In exchange, some of Bowser's heavier hitting moves were
  nerfed, such as up air, and his infamous up throw combos.
