name: Bayonetta
render: /img/bayonetta.png
description: >-
  Bayonetta in Smash 4 was considered by many players as the best character in
  the game, even after having received nerfs in updates, due to many of her
  extreme advantages remaining intact, including most infamously her ability to
  KO opponents at virtually any percentage with successful ladder combos. These
  traits often caused players to label her as "broken", and many matches
  involving her became controversial, including one at the Super Smash Bros.
  Invitational 2018, where the top professional Bayonetta player MKLeo pulled
  off a ladder KO in front of Masahiro Sakurai. Possibly as a result of these
  events, Bayonetta has been significantly nerfed in the transition to Ultimate,
  and is by far the most nerfed character in the game, in a similar vein to Meta
  Knight in Smash 4.
