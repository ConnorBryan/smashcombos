name: Dark Samus
render: /img/placeholder.png
description: >-
  As with some Echo Fighters, Dark Samus is nearly identical gameplay-wise to
  Samus, with barely-noticeable differences. However, she has many basic
  animations that are different from Samus, a more standard roll which does not
  involve turning into a Morph Ball, electric effects instead of fire effects
  for most of Samus's fire-based moves, and slightly different hitboxes for a
  handful of moves.
